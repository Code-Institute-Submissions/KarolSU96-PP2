## Bugs:

Throughout the developlent process I struggled with delete function. Somehow my approach wasnt working or was not consistent. I figured out that it there must be someting going on with the icon, after carefully examining the page with Pesticide Chrome excension. I managed to find a thread on stack https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60692659/icon-makes-the-button-not-clickable and changed the pointer-events stling to none. Wokred like a charm after that.
